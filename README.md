## Features

- [x] Authenticate using AWS `~/.aws/credentials`
- [x] Show dynamoDB records as JSON using monaco editor
- [ ] Edit dynamoDB records as JSON using monaco editor
- [ ] Query and Scan on Primary, Local Secondary, and Global Secondary indexes
- [ ] Use the aws-sdk for dynamo to design and test queries inside an authenticated REPL

## Configuration

Configuration is supported via the AWS credentials and config files.

By default all available profiles are show in the profile selection.

Here are some examples:

### Standard Profile

```
~/.aws/credentials
[profile-name]
aws_access_key_id = id
aws_secret_access_key = secret
```

### MFA Profile

```
~/.aws/credentials
[profile-name]
aws_access_key_id = id
aws_secret_access_key = secret
```

```
~/.aws/config
[profile mfa-profile]
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_arn>:mfa/<username>
source_profile = profile-name
```

### Assume Role in another Account

```
~/.aws/credentials
[profile-name]
aws_access_key_id = id
aws_secret_access_key = secret
```

```
~/.aws/config
[profile assumed-role]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<aws_target_account_arn>:role/<RoleName>
source_profile = profile-name
```

### Assume Role with MFA

```
~/.aws/credentials
[profile-name]
aws_access_key_id = id
aws_secret_access_key = secret
```

```
~/.aws/config
[profile mfa-assumed-role]
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_arn>:mfa/<username>
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<aws_target_account_arn>:role/<RoleName>
source_profile = profile-name
```

### Local

Setup a local dynamoDB agent on a specified port.

```
~/.aws/config
[profile local]
region = local
output = json
endpoint=http://localhost:8000
```

## Contributing

### Local Run

Running the project locally by pull/forking:

```
yarn install

yarn start
```

### Tests

jest is the test runner used for unit testing:

```
yarn test

```

### End to End testing

Cypress is used for end to end testing using component mounting:

```
yarn cy
```

To update failing snapshots run:

```
yarn cy:u
```

## Releasing

Currently the release process is automated to produce drafts as Beta releases until a stable version is ready.

The release process is.

1. Create a release branch
2. Run the release command
   1. `yarn pub:beta`
   2. Answer yes to all
3. Github Actions will kick off following the creation of the tag, and binaries for the supported operating systems will be produced.
